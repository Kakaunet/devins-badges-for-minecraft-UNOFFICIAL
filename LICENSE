Copyright © 2025 "Kakaunet"

Permission is granted to any person obtaining a copy of this work (“the Work”) to use, copy, and (under the conditions below) redistribute it, subject to the following terms:

1. Non-commercial redistribution only

You may not redistribute the Work, in whole or in part, for any commercial purpose or in any context where you receive money or other commercial advantage in connection with that redistribution, unless you have separate written permission from the copyright holder.

2. No attribution requirement

You are not required to credit or attribute the copyright holder when using or redistributing the Work under this license, unless you choose to do so or unless another agreement requires it.

3. Redistribution for access and same-license requirement

If you redistribute the Work (or a modified version of it) for free, and the main purpose of that redistribution is to give other people access to the Work itself (for example, passing it along, sharing copies), then:

You must license that redistribution under this same license, without adding terms that conflict with it.

You must not impose any additional restrictions that would limit what this license allows.

Redistributions whose primary purpose is access to the Work are covered by this clause, whether they are digital or physical.

4. Termination and reinstatement

Automatic termination for violation.
If you violate any term of this license, your rights under it terminate automatically and immediately, without notice from the copyright holder.

Termination at the copyright holder’s discretion.
The copyright holder may, at any time and for any reason, terminate your rights under this license, either individually (for you) or generally (for everyone), by giving notice through reasonable means (for example, public notice or direct communication).

Effect of termination.
Upon termination, you must stop all use of the Work allowed by this license and destroy or permanently delete all copies of the Work that you control, except where you are legally required to keep copies.

Reinstatement only by explicit permission.
After termination, your rights under this license can be restored only if the copyright holder explicitly grants you new permission (for example, in writing).
There is no automatic reinstatement of rights, even if you later stop violating the license or correct your behavior.

5. No loopholes / good-faith interpretation

You must not try to use gaps, ambiguities, or “loopholes” in this license to act against its clear purpose and spirit. Any attempt to circumvent the restrictions and conditions above, even if you claim a formal or technical reading allows it, will be treated as a violation of this license.

You agree to interpret and apply this license in good faith, in line with its obvious intent:

to allow non-commercial use,

to forbid commercial redistribution without separate permission,

to require this same license when redistributing the Work for access, and

to preserve the copyright holder’s right to terminate or reinstate access.

6. No warranty

The Work is provided “as is”, without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The copyright holder will not be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability arising from the use of the Work.
