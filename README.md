- **If it starts with "UNKNOWN: ", that means that this is a custom-made badge that is not made by me, but i cannot remember where it came from.**
- **If it does not start with any of these two, that means that they are original badges, made by Intergrav. The original badges can be found here: [https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges) or here: [https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges-docs/](https://intergrav.github.io/devins-badges-docs/).**

This is a list of useful badges (from Devin's Badges, and custom-made ones using the template) for Minecraft mods, datapacks, resourcepacks, and etc.

All the files have not yet been uploaded. More will be uploaded soon.
